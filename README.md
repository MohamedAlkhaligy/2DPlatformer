# 2DPlatformer Game
This is a Speulnky-like game made in a **WEEK** (That's why the UI is very simple) to practice some mechanics and core game design.

The game is composed of three main levels(For now) each level is to test/experiment a certain mechanism in the game.

## Warning
I don't own the sprites used in the game. If you want to use them commercialy, buy them from unity's Asset store
